# CryptoCredible
#### The missing crypto exchange data exporter

###### _tldr: run locally to export your crypto tx data from popular exchanges via api connections._

Every tried to export your transactions only to find out there's a load of data missing? ðŸ™„ Well, this tool might be for you...

Run it locally to fetch your transaction data from popular crypto exchanges using their API connections. The tool then processes the data into a csv file with a standard format, regardless of the format the exchange provides. No missing data and all trades, deposits and withdrawals properly categorised.

What's better is the output is designed to work perfectly with the amazing open source tax software [BittyTax](https://github.com/BittyTax/BittyTax).
